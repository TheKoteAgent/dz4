        <h2 class="title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="inst-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Beat the eggs</strong>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a
            pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
            tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat the pan</strong>: Place a non-stick frying pan over
            medium heat and add butter or oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Cook the omelette</strong>: Once the butter is melted and
            bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
            coat the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add fillings (optional)</strong>: When the eggs begin to set
            at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
            your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fold and serve</strong>: As the omelette continues to cook,
            carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
            for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Enjoy</b>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
